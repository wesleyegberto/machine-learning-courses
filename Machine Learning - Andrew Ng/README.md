# Machine Learning by Stanford Univerty - Coursera

Class given by Andrew Ng.


### Week 1 and 2

#### Algorithms
* Regression (Projection)
  * Univariate Linear Regression
  * Multivariate Linear Regression

#### Techniques
* Cost functions:
  * Mean Square Error
  * Logistic Error
* Minimization - Find parameters value:
  * Gradient Descent
  * Normal Equation
* Pre-processing Dataset:
  * Scale Normalization
  * Mean Normalization
    

### Week 3

#### Algorithms
* Classifiers
  * Logistic Regression
  * Multiclass Logistic Regression (One-vs-All)

#### Techniques
* Cost function:
  * Logistic (MSE will generate multi vales - won't converge)
* Minimization:
  * Gradient Descent
  * Find minimum of unconstrained multivariable function (fminunc)
* Feature map
* Regularization
  * Reduce number of features
  * Model selection algorithm
  * Parameters regulaziation
    * Keep all features but we apply a cost to it
    * Apply in cost function and gradient descent


## Week 4

#### Algorithms
* Multiclass Logistic Regression (One-vs-All)
* Neural Network
  * Model representation
  * Non-linear classifier
  * Sigmoid activiation function
  * Forward Propagation

#### Techniques
* Cost functions:
  * Logistic cost
  * Mean Square Error
* Minimization:
  * Gradient Descent
  * fmincg



## Stanford Honor Code

Please, do not use it in yours assigments.

"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
