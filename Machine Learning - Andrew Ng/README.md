# Machine Learning by Stanford Univerty - Coursera

Class given by Andrew Ng.


### Week 1 and 2

#### Algorithms
* Regression (Projection)
  * Univariate Linear Regression
  * Multivariate Linear Regression

#### Techniques
* Cost functions:
  * Mean Square Error
  * Logistic Error
* Minimization - Find parameters value:
  * Gradient Descent
  * Normal Equation
* Pre-processing Dataset:
  * Scale Normalization
  * Mean Normalization
    

### Week 3

#### Algorithms
* Classification
  * Logistic Regression
  * Multiclass Logistic Regression

#### Techniques
* Cost function:
  * Logistic (MSE will generate multi vales - won't converge)
* Minimization:
  * Gradient Descent
  * Find minimum of unconstrained multivariable function (fminunc)
* Regularization
  * Reduce number of features
  * Model selection algorithm
  * Parameters regulaziation
    * Keep all features but we apply a cost to it
    * Apply in cost function and gradient descent
